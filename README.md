# gcloud-wagon-private

Deploy and consume artifacts in private S3 repositories. Designed to
be used from [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen),
but should be usable in other contexts by deploying to repositories at
"gcloud://" URLs.

## Usage

### Leiningen 2.x

Add the plugin and repositories listing to `project.clj`:

```clj
:plugins [[gcloud-wagon-private "1.2.0"]]
```

You can store credentials either in an encrypted file or as
environment variables. For the encrypted file, add this to
`project.clj`:

```clj
:repositories [["private" {:url "gcloud://mybucket/releases/" :creds :gpg}]]
```

And in `~/.lein/credentials.clj.gpg`:

```
{"gcloud://mybucket/releases" {:username "AKIA2489AE28488"
                            :passphrase "98b0b104ca1211e19a6c"}}
```

The username and passphrase here correspond to the AWS Access Key and Secret
Key, respectively.

The map key here can be either a string for an exact match or a regex
checked against the repository URL if you have the same credentials
for multiple repositories.

To use the environment for credentials, include
`:username :env :passphrase :env` instead of `:creds :gpg` and export
`LEIN_USERNAME` and `LEIN_PASSPHRASE` environment variables.

See `lein help deploying` for details on storing credentials.

If you are running Leiningen in an environment where you don't control
the user such as Heroku or Jenkins, you can include credentials in the
`:repositories` entry. However, you should avoid committing them to
your project, so you should take them from the environment using
`System/getenv`:

```clj
(defproject my-project "1.0.0"
  :plugins [[gcloud-wagon-private "1.2.0"]]
  :repositories {"releases" {:url "gcloud://mybucket/releases/"
                             :username :env/aws_access_key ;; gets environment variable AWS_ACCESS_KEY
                             :passphrase :env/aws_secret_key}}) ;; gets environment variable AWS_SECRET_KEY 
```
